# hyperion-webos

Still highly experimental and not in active development.

* It uses private API in webOS system, and it changes often across versions, causes it only working in certain TV
* In most cases rooting your TV is required
* Event it works, it will break something like "No signal" screen or even HDMI input, causes wild flickering until reboot
